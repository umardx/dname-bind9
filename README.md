# DNAME - Redirection in the DNS
Assume the company which owns example.com has been taken over by a company which owns the domain example.net. Further, assume that example.com used to provide a web site www.example.com and a public ftp site ftp.example.com and these will now be hosted under the example.net domain with names of www.example.example.net (for web site) and ftp.example.example.net (for ftp site). Additionally assume we will handle mail addresses of the form user@example.com at mail.example.net. There are two methods of doing this - multiple CNAME RRs or a DNAME RR at the zone apex.
